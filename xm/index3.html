It is also the most comprehensive and authoritative gallery for collecting Spanish paintings. The Museum has a large collection of European art treasures from the 12th to 19th centuries.

                <p>Alhambra Palace is a complex of ancient mosques, palaces and castles built during the Moorish Dynasty in Granada, southern Spain. The original site of the Alhambra Palace was a fortress called Al-Andalus, built by the former King of the Moors of Granada, and now it is a Muslim building and cultural museum. On the wooded top of the hill, the 150-metre-high Alhambra Palace stands high above the city, harmoniously integrated with the Medieval Albertin area opposite. Its architectural form reflects the history of Spanish-Moorish rule in the city. Since then, the commemorative buildings built in the city have respected and maintained this original harmonious state.</p>

In the creation of human architecture in the 1990s, Bilbao Guggenheim Museum is undoubtedly one of the greatest.

The Great Mosque was first built in the 8th century as a Roman church, and then Muslims occupied Cordoba and rebuilt half of the then Visigoth Catholic Church. After the recovery movement, Cordoba became a Christian area again in 1236, and the Great Mosque was transformed into a Roman Catholic Church and a Roman Catholic Church.</p>
